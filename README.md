# Data Science & Machine Learning
## Resources
- [GitHub Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
- [PyTorch Cheatsheet](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html)
- `Awesome Data Science` "ever-growing list of amazing resources for data science. It has everything you can imagine related to the topic with hundreds of useful resources ranging from theory to practice." [link](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience)

## Tools
- `Nbviewer` This tool is awesome and allows you to render jupyter notebooks from different repositories directly on the browser just by copying the link to it. [link](https://nbviewer.org/)
- `Orchest` is a tool for quickly building data pipelines. With it, you can construct pipelines visually, code in notebooks, and much more. [link](https://github.com/orchest/orchest?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
- `Readme.so` is a really neat tool and allows you to quickly customize sections of your readme file to make it look as good as possible for your projects. [link](https://readme.so/)
- `User Benchmark` is a great tool when you are setting up your new machine and want to compare benchmarks for different commercially available GPUs. [link](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-3080-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3070/4080vs4083)
- `Excalidraw` helps a lot because it facilitates the creation of basic drawings that are helpful in this type of context, so I have been using it to make sketches of processes like data pipelines and model architectures. [link](https://excalidraw.com/)
